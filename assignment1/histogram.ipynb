In particular, it has been shown how the **Histogram Equalization** algorithm can be used to increase the global contrast of an image by mapping intensities to a more uniform distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "The horizontal axis of the histograms represents the intensity levels, ranging from dark to light. The vertical axis represents the number of pixels in the grayscale image with a particular intensity level. Given this ordering, it's not surprising that for the dark and light images, the distribution is concentrated on the left and right hand side of the range, respectively. However, it's an important observation, that low contrast of an image corresponds to a narrow distribution, while in a high contrast image, the distribution is almost uniform.\n",
